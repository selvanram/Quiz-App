	-Each choice, when you hover over it turns orange. The questions are in black, the choices in blue
	-A correct answer should add a point to the correct answer total
	-Include a total and a correct total
	-If you score 5/5, the screen says something fancy
X. A ribbon at the top. On the left is a Reset link and on the right is a reset button
X. A Begin Quiz Circle that flashes, when you click on it, the first question appears. The reset button should take you back to the Begin Quiz Circle.
